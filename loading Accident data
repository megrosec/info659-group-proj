Load the libraries: 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

Load the data:

```{r}
accident_data = read.csv("CRSS2022CSV/CRSS2022CSV/accident.csv")
```

Showing the first beginning of the data to ensure that data has been loaded properly

```{r}
str(accident_data)

```

Introducing the variables: 

1. CASENUM: Case number

2. REGIONNAME : Geographic region's name

3. URBANICITYNAME : Describes the level of urbanicity (urban or rural areas)

4. HOUR_IM: represent the hour of the incident

5. RELJCT2_IMNAME : Describes the relation to the junction for the second incident or vehicle (e.g., “At Intersection”)

6. LGTCON_IMNAME: Describes light conditions

7. WEATHR_IMNAME: Describes weather conditions 

8. MAXSEV_IM: Code indicating the maximum severity level of the incident

9. MAXSEV_IMNAME: Descriptive name for MAXSEV_IM

10. NO_INJ_IM : Represents the number of injuries 

11. ALCHL_IMNAME: Describes alcohol involvement 

12. MONTHNAME: Month of the incident 


Cleaning the data: 

```{r}
# Replace missing values in categorical columns with "Unknown"
accident_data = accident_data %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, ~replace(., is.na(.), "Unknown"))

# Replace missing values in numeric columns with the median
accident_data = accident_data %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~replace(., is.na(.), median(., na.rm = TRUE)))

```

```{r}
cleaned_data = accident_data %>%
  select(CASENUM, REGIONNAME, URBANICITYNAME, MONTHNAME, HOUR_IM, RELJCT2_IMNAME, LGTCON_IMNAME, WEATHR_IMNAME, MAXSEV_IM, MAXSEV_IMNAME, NO_INJ_IM, ALCHL_IMNAME)
```

```{r}
# Rename columns for clarity
renamed_accident_data = cleaned_data %>%
  rename(
    case_number = CASENUM,
    region_name = REGIONNAME, 
    urbancity_name = URBANICITYNAME, 
    month_name = MONTHNAME,
    hour = HOUR_IM, 
    junction_name = RELJCT2_IMNAME, 
    light_condition = LGTCON_IMNAME, 
    weather_name = WEATHR_IMNAME, 
    max_severity_level = MAXSEV_IM, 
    max_severity_des = MAXSEV_IMNAME, 
    injur_no = NO_INJ_IM,
    alcohol_involved = ALCHL_IMNAME
  )
renamed_accident_data
```

#we can check for in which month the accidents are high
#where accidents are high or in what region the accidents are high - is it in urban or rural areas
#the weather condtion 
#how severity the injury level 
#the time at which the accident occur: check for the most common time 
#the number of injuries
#is there any alcohol involvement 


Removing any duplicates 
```{r}
renamed_accident_data =  renamed_accident_data %>% distinct()
renamed_accident_data
```
